# Profile

Basic portfolio page built out using only HTML and CSS. About me page contains bio and contact information, and Portfolio page contains recent projects with links to deployed sites and github repositories. 

This is my portfolio page. Here you can find a little about me and why I got into web development. This is where you can also find my resume, my LinkedIn, my GitHub profile, and my latest projects. Its themed around the marketplace I'd like to get into, which is Los Angeles, and is simple so anyone that wants to see my work can easily navigate through it. I streamlined this page from the previous version to make it more sleek and to ensure that its focus is on the information about me.
